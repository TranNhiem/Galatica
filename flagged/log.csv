The 2D images are obtained by slicing the 3D images along the axial direction. The 2D images are then used to train the model. The 2D images are usually obtained by using a 2D slice-selection method. The 2D images are then used to train the model. The 2D images are usually obtained by using a 2D slice-selection method. The 2D images are then used to train the model.
